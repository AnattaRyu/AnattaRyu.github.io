              <p>I've been playing badminton for about 5 years now, and it's become a big part of my life. I enjoy the physical and mental workout, and I love the feeling of hitting that perfect shot. There's something about the speed that keeping me for coming back to play.</p>

              <h2>Books</h2>
              <img src="image/image3.jpeg" class="card-image">
              <p>The way books can transport you to different worlds and teach you valuable lessons is the reason why i like reading. Besides books, I also read manhwa and manga, so i will read them if there is no interesting book. I love to spend my leisure time by reading books.</p>

              <img src="image/image4.jpg" class="card-image">
              <p>I also likes to watch movies, for me watching movies is like when your thoughts become reality. I have watched a movies that get an adaptation from the book I read, the feeling when your thoughts actually become reality is very interesting for me.</p>

              <img src="image/image5.jpg" class="card-image">
              <p>Actually i don't listen to music that often, only a few times. For example, when I make this website or do homework maybe. I don't know why, but music makes me thinks faster and logical.</p>

                <p>I've been working on this "xinshi" Dormitory Cafetaria for almost a year right now. I honestly didn't expect that I'll do somekind of part-time job when I first got here, but my friends once asked me wether I want to do part-time job with him, that time I only accept him on a whim. But after a while working here, I started to love my work-place. My boss has been a really nice person towards all of us, she always emphasize that money doesn't always dictates whats the definition of happiness, but our attitude and our-way of thiking that brings us happiness in our own lives. </p>
